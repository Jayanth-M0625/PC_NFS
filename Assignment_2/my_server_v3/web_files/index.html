    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am an undergraduate pursuing Mechanical Engineering. This degree is more like a hobby because I love cars and planes and physics!
    I don't hate mathematics but I don't love it either. I was born curious and I love learning new technologies. 
    This is what I am good at and this what I want to do for a living.
    </p>
    <h2>Why this website?</h2>
    <p>Because learning get's interesting with sharing. I want to share all the knowledge I am aquiring so people who are reading this don't go through the same problems as I do.
    Also because teaching someone else is the best way to check one's own knowledge.
    </p>
    <h2>What will you get from this website?</h2>
    <p>Idk.. 
    I will add content whenever I feel like and throw some light on my very eccentric learning style.
    </p>
    <p>If you want to play a fun game before leaving, go to /game. </p>
    <p>See you later! Have a nice day!</p>
