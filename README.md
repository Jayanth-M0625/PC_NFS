Informal description of what each folder contains:
>Assignment 1 contains my solutions to rustlings until chapter 8 in the book (exercise 11 in the repo)
>Assignment 2 contains the webserver. I was learning how webservers work for the first time so I built it slowly through 3 iterations. (I had planned more iterations after 3 to dive into async but we moved on to file system implementation)
>Assignment 3 contains the file system implementation. "dist-intro" contains the functions that were to be used in the distributed part which I caouldn't implement correctly. "filesystems-distributed-ufs" contains the local test filesystem.
  I had written my functions in _server_funcs.c_ and to test them I used the script in _interact.c_.
